## CLI wallet program `proxi`

`proxi` is a small CLI program with basic tools for Proxima. Please, do not expect perfect UX :) 

The program can be compiled by typing `go install` in the `<root>/proxi` directory of the Proxima source.

Commands `proxi -h`, `proxi db -h`, `proxi node -h`, etc. will display help text. 

Some commands, for example `proxi gen` are completely stand alone and does not require any config profile.
Most of the commands require configuration profile in the working directory. 

`proxi` configuration profile usually is file `proxi.yaml`. If we use a file 
with another name, say `proxi2.yaml`, we have to specify it explicitly in the command line with flag `-c` 
and profile file mame without extension, for example `proxi node balance -c proxi2`.

`proxi` commands has a form `proxi <cmd group> <subcommand> <args and flags>`, where `<cmd group>` is one of the following:

* `proxi init` is for admin subcommands, for initialization of the database. config profiles and similar 
* `proxi db`  for admin subcommands which access multi-state database directly. They will all fail if node is running
* `proxi snapshot` for subcommands related to snapshots
* `proxi gen` helper subcommands which needs generation of private keys (only for testing!) used in genesis, hostIDs and wallets.
* `proxi node` many subcommands which accesses node via API. They all require configuration profile and an endpoint in the running node

### 1. Create configuration profile and the wallet

The command `proxi init wallet` asks for entropy and generates private key from the provided seed and system randomness.
It also creates configuration profile `proxi.yaml`.

The file will contain something like this (with comments):

```yaml
private_key: af274b0363f484f8d113a9e17831ff3acd285fd152c5179db42ab0ff976e23153a51eabb1c19f1b5e784d086a6bf176c8ada3c248f25da93f7362c35eb1fc660
account: addressED25519(0x7450c426206c4164bc84ff30a14bdf72603b563e26a1d43973bc67cdb59033d8)
sequencer_id: <own sequencer ID>
api:
  endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:8000
tag_along:
  sequencer_id: af7bedde1fea222230b82d63d5b665ac75afbe4ad3f75999bb3386cf994a6963
  fee: 500
finality:
  inclusion_threshold:
    numerator: 2
    denominator: 3
  weak: false
spammer:
  bundle_size: 5
  output_amount: 1000
  pace: 25
  tag_along:
    fee: 500
    sequencer_id: <sequencer ID hex encoded>
  target: <target address in EasyFL format>
```

Usually some adjustments are needed to complete the profile. 

`wallet.private_key` contains hex encoded raw data of the ED25519 private key. The file must be kept secret 
because of this private key. 

`wallet.account` contains address constraint in the _EasyFL_ format which matches the private key. 

`sequencer_id` is an optional field if you do not run sequencer. It contains `sequencer ID` of the sequencer controlled by this wallet. 
It is necessary in order to access sequencer controlled by this private key with the `proxi node seq withdraw ..` command. 

`api.endpoint` must contain endpoint for the node's API

`tag_along.sequencer_id` is a mandatory field for any commands which issue transactions, such as `proxi node transfer`.
It must contain sequencer which is used as tag-along sequencer. Each issued transaction will contain so-called _tag-along output_.
The *tag-along output* simply sends amount of tokens specified in `tag_along.fee` to the sequencer in `tag_along.sequencer_id`. 
The sequencer will consume the fee in its transaction. This will pull the transaction into the next ledger state. 
By default, `proxi.yaml` is initialized with the static constant of 
bootstrap sequencer ID `af7bedde1fea222230b82d63d5b665ac75afbe4ad3f75999bb3386cf994a6963`. 

Other default values can be left as is in the beginning.

### Transaction and other IDs
Transaction ID in proxima is 32 byte array. First 5 bytes are the timestamp of the transaction, the rest 27 bytes are 
taken from `blake2b` hash of the transaction bytes.

The transaction ID or its short (trimmed) form is often displayed like this:

`[58514|30sq]fd9d612d07f0d235c627b720f70fe5c84ac6b0f7f296097197fed5`
or
`[58565|0br]bf8b9bc628dacecc923dcb68715b94556f81c856674f1383a7b945`

The `58514` is slot number. The `sq` means it is non-branch sequencer transaction and `30` is number of ticks in the slot.
The rest is hex-encoded 27 bytes of transaction hash.

If `br` is used instead of `sq`, it means it is branch transaction. Baranch transactions always have `0` ticks, i.e. they are
_on the slot boundary_.
If `sq` and `br` are skipped, it is an ordinary, non-sequencer transaction, produced by user wallet. 

The output (aka UTXO) on the ledger belongs to a transaction and has index in it. 
Index is displayed as postfix of the transaction ID.

For example `[58579|25]6f0b55301a97884f3fd8b4f44ef2c682b81ecda38d2b35a2116bfb[3]` is output of the non-sequencer transaction with index 3. 
Short for of the same output (only for display) would be `[58579|25]6f0b55..[3]`

Usual ED25519 address takes form `a(0x370563b1f08fcc06fa250c59034acfd4ab5a29b60640f751d644e9c3b84004d0)`, which contains 
hash of the public key. We will skip details here.

Chain ID is a 32 byte array. It is displayed in the hex-encoded form, often with prefix `$/`. 

For example `$/af7bedde1fea222230b82d63d5b665ac75afbe4ad3f75999bb3386cf994a6963` is the pre-defined constant chain ID of the bootstrap 
(genesis) chain.

### Some useful `proxi node` commands

* `proxi node lrb` displays **latest reliable branch (LRB)** info. _LRB_ represents the ledger state which is contained
by all the current healthy ledger states, i.e. it is the **consensus ledger state** with high probability.
   Usually we require our transaction to be included into the LRB or earlier branches. 

   If LRB is more than few slots back from now, it may indicate that node is not synced with the network. 

   LRB information also contains ID of the sequencer which produced the branch, total supply of tokens on the ledger state and the _ledger coverage_ of the branch.
   Initial token balance of the ledger at genesis in testnet is 1.000.000.000.000.000.000 tokens
   The total supply on the LRB ledger state is constantly changing according to the inflation rules.

   The _ledger coverage_ must be > of the supply for the branch to be _healthy_. The maximum possible value of the ledger coverage is _2 x supply_.

* `proxi node balance` displays token balance on the usual (ED25519) address and on chains, controlled by the account in the LRB branch.  
   Token balance is sum of tokens contained in non-chain outputs plus sum of balances contained in chain outputs. 

* `proxi node chains` displays all chain outputs controlled by the account on LRB state

* `proxi node transfer <amount> -t "<target address>"` sends tokens from the wallet's account to the target address.
  For example command `proxi node transfer 1000 -t "a(0x370563b1f08fcc06fa250c59034acfd4ab5a29b60640f751d644e9c3b84004d0)"`
  sends 1000 tokens to the specified address. The transfer transaction will contain so called **tag-along** output with **tag-along fee**
  paid to the **tag-along sequencer** configured in the `proxi.yaml`.
  Flag  `-v` (or `--verbose`) will make command to display the whole transfer transaction. It is a good chance to get acquainted with the Proxima's UTXO transaction model.

* `proxi node compact` transfers tokens to itself by compacting outputs in the account. It is useful when account contains too much outputs. 
   This often happens as a result of the spamming. 
   Note that than `compact` command still requires tag-along fee. 

* `proxi node outputs` displays outputs (UTXOs) in the account

* `proxi node info` displays info of the node

* `proxi node getfunds` requests funds from a faucet server  
  The following settings can be used to specify a faucet server (addr:port) in `proxi.yaml`:

  ```yaml
  faucet:
      port:  9500
      addr:  http://172.16.238.10
  ```
  

### 2. Run spammer from the wallet

Spammer is used as a testing tool and to study behavior of the system. 
Spammer periodically sends tokens from the wallet's account to the target address in bundles of transactions. 
It waits each bundle of transactions reaches finality before sending the next one.

Spammer is run with the command `proxi node spam`.

The bundle of transactions is a chain of transactions which consumes output of the previous. 
Only the last one (tip of the batch) contains tag-along output. 

Configured tag-along sequencer consumes the output (the tip of the batch). 
This way it pulls the whole bundle of transactions into the ledger state with one tag-along fee amount.

As per current ledger constraints one spammer can achieve maximum 1 TPS of the transfer transactions. 
In Proxima rate is limited per address (per user) and it is 1 TPS for non-sequencers (assuming no conflicting transactions are issued).
Higher TPS can be reached only by multiple users. 

### 3. Setup a faucet server

To start a faucet server use the command `proxi node faucet`

Configure a faucet server with the following settings in your `proxi.yaml`:

```yaml
faucet:
    output_amount: 1000000
    port: 9500
    account: a(0xe141252fd0ff04d12f9d485abfee4976e81aa1cde436e8b9afde5b859d121e3e)
    priv_key: aba821559e43cb665cda00cf544c4de6f1ca331056c7af3c2f483d3096476c5de3922e3138fb163af608a5f4feada96495c038f6e179850efa30e81ea8ec1604
    time_between_requests: 30
```

`faucet.output_amount` contains the amount that is returned upon a request. 

`faucet.port` specifies the port on which the server will listen for requests. 

`faucet.account` specifies the account from which the server will redraw the funds. 

`faucet.priv_key` specifies the private key for the account to withdraw. If no private key is specified, the funds will be withdrawn from the sequencer chain.

`faucet.time_between_requests` specifies the minimal allowed time between requests from the same account/address.
