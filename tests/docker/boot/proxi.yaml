finality:
    # finality rule used by the wallet. It has no effect on the way transaction is treated by the network
    inclusion_threshold:
        # numerator / denominator is the 'theta' in the WP.
        # with strong finality, the wallet waits until all branches in last 2 slots with coverage > numerator / denominator
        # contains the transaction
        # With weak finality inclusion_threshold has no effect
        numerator: 2
        denominator: 3
        # strong: based on ledger coverage and inclusion_threshold (see above)
        # weak: wait until all branches in last 2 slots contains the transaction.
        # The weak finality may be used when less than totalSupply/2 of sequencers are active,
        # for example during bootstrap
    weak: false
